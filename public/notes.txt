 During this difficult time, Sharon Cleaners opened a web site to communicate with the community
                        in the fight
                        against the corona virus (COVID-19). Sharon Cleaners wants to overcome the Corona Virus
                        (COVID-19) with the
                        community. Dry cleaning solvents have been proven to kill other influenza strains in combination
                        with the heat of the dry cleaning process. There are still many unknowns about this virus, but
                        this is the CDCâ€™s recommended cleaning process for killing viruses. Dispose of all laundry in
                        hot water at 160F, the most effective way to disinfect laundry. Rest assured, your apparel and
                        household items go well with us. The locations of the two stores are still open so you can
                        continue to serve the community. If you have items in a closed area, please book delivery.
